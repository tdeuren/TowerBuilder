# TowerBuilder
This is a game in made using pygame. 
There is a moving block at the top of the screen. If arrow key down is pressed, the block falls down.
You get one point if the block falls on the previous block (except the first block). If the block falls perfectly on the previous one, you get 10 points.
The game stops if the block doesn't fall on the previous block.
The highest score is kept and changes if a new highscore is reached.
